  abstract = {This paper relates to analyses and control of the oscillations occurring
	in many off road vehicles, which are designed without any suspension.
	Without suspension, the tire is the only elastic element acting between
	the vehicle and the ground but the suspension and damping properties
	of the tires cannot meet the demands for fast, safe and comfortable
	road transportation. In this paper the above-mentioned phenomenon
	is investigated with special focus on agricultural tractors. A control
	strategy is developed to make the implement counteract the movement
	of the tractor and thereby reducing the pitching oscillation. The
	control strategy is based on a linear plant model with constant or
	slowly varying parameters. Using a frequency-response approach the
	disturbance rejection is made effective over a significant portion
	of the system bandwidth. To improve robustness with respect to bounded
	disturbances (from the road) natural frequencies for the vehicle
	and implement is identified and the controller parameters tuned adaptively
	based on an optimization formulation.},
