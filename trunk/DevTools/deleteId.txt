The program deleteID can be used for deleting id's from a .cmd -file.
The adams id's might give problems, therefore it is better to delete them.

To use the program:
Java has to be installed on the computer: if not http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
Place the .cmd -file in the same directory as the program.
Start a command prompt.
Navigate to the folder where both the program and the file is located
In the command prompt write:
    java deleteID somefile
  where somefile is the name of the .cmd -file without .cmd
  Remember java is case sensitive.
A file where all id's is deleted is placed in the folder.
